{"name":"TabBack","tagline":"Get your Tabs Back!","body":"![TabBack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rageandqq/TabBack/master/TabBack.safariextension/Icon.png)\r\n\r\nReopen multiple closed tabs in Safari!  \r\n**\"Alt+Shift+T\"** to re-open the last closed tab, useable multiple times.  \r\n\r\n##Description\r\n_A simple solution to a painful problem._  \r\nUnlike in Google Chrome, where Command+Shift+T reopens the last closed tab(s), there is no such utility in Safari.  \r\nYou can only open the last tab you closed with Command+Z, but not more than that.  \r\n\r\nTabBack allows you open multiple closed tabs, using the key-sequence **Alt+Shift+T**.  \r\n(Command+Shift+T is reserved for showing the tabs bar).\r\n\r\nNo dependencies, no bulky features, and no managers required.  \r\nJust JavaScript.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nTo install:\r\n* Download [TabBack.safariextz](https://github.com/rageandqq/TabBack/blob/master/TabBack.safariextz?raw=true)\r\n* Open the file (with Safari)\r\n* Grant required permissions\r\n* Restart your browser\r\n\r\nAfter that, you're good to go and get your Tabs Back!","google":"UA-56979695-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
